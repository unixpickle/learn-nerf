# learn-nerf

This is a repo for implementing and experimenting with [Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) and various follow-up works. I've been curious about this line of research for a while, but don't have much time to explore it. I learn best by doing, so I'll be implementing stuff here to try to get the hang of it.
